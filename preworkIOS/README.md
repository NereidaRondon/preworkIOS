## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Since I've never used Xcode before, I was not familiar with the process of comitting code to GitHub on this IDE. I am accustomed to using the terminal and putting in the commands to push the code but I did it using the GUI. Additionally, I had to figure out how to add a README file from within Xcode.
